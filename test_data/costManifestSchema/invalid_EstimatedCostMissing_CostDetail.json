The only application USF requires to determine financial aid eligibility is the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). The FAFSA is available every year after October 1 and should be completed prior to April 15 prior to the start of an academic year to ensure students receive the maximum amount of aid for which they are eligible. Prior to being able to apply for financial aid, we want to afford students the opportunity to determine an estimate of their financial aid eligibility prior to the FAFSA being made available. Please complete the appropriate Net Price Calculator to see how affordable USF can be.",
