Standard scores are determined by dividing the number of questions answered correctly by the number possible within the standard.  Standard scores are considered weighted because each standard does not contain the same number of questions.  Scores are represented by percentages.  A total score is calculated by dividing the total number of questions answered correctly across all standard areas by the total number of points possible across standard areas.\n\n",

      "ceterms:verificationMethodDescription": "A key strength of all NOCTI assessments concerns content validity. That validity is based upon the fact that each assessment is built upon national/industry standards and reflects the critical core competencies required in the occupation as reflected in associated job-task analyses performed during the development/revision process. Since NOCTI’s assessment development methods rely on subject matter experts to assess the relationship between the assessment content and the defined universe of the job title, NOCTI assessments are a content valid measure of the required skills in a given job title. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) state that content-related evidence demonstrates the degree to which the sample of items, tasks, or questions on a test are representative of some defined universe or domain of content. The methods often rely on expert judgments to assess this relationship. Thus, the content validity of NOCTI Assessments is in accordance with the Standards endorsed by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).\n\nThe reliability of an assessment refers to its consistency of measurement (i.e., the absence of measurement errors). NOCTI works to ensure that all of the assessments that we create have a stable and consistent performance of measurement. One approach used to demonstrate that an assessment is providing a reliable measurement of participant skill and/or knowledge is internal consistency. This measure is often used with written (cognitive) assessments and is calculated using a statistical software package such as SPSS or item analysis programs; NOCTI utilizes both types of programs.  The higher the internal consistency the more reliable the assessment.\n"

      "ceterms:verificationMethodDescription": "A key strength of all NOCTI assessments concerns content validity. That validity is based upon the fact that each assessment is built upon national/industry standards and reflects the critical core competencies required in the occupation as reflected in associated job-task analyses performed during the development/revision process. Since NOCTI’s assessment development methods rely on subject matter experts to assess the relationship between the assessment content and the defined universe of the job title, NOCTI assessments are a content valid measure of the required skills in a given job title. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) state that content-related evidence demonstrates the degree to which the sample of items, tasks, or questions on a test are representative of some defined universe or domain of content. The methods often rely on expert judgments to assess this relationship. Thus, the content validity of NOCTI Assessments is in accordance with the Standards endorsed by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).\n\nThe reliability of an assessment refers to its consistency of measurement (i.e., the absence of measurement errors). NOCTI works to ensure that all of the assessments that we create have a stable and consistent performance of measurement. One approach used to demonstrate that an assessment is providing a reliable measurement of participant skill and/or knowledge is internal consistency. This measure is often used with written (cognitive) assessments and is calculated using a statistical software package such as SPSS or item analysis programs; NOCTI utilizes both types of programs.  The higher the internal consistency the more reliable the assessment.\n"

That validity is based upon the fact that each assessment is built upon national/industry standards and reflects the critical core competencies required in the occupation as reflected in associated job-task analyses performed during the development/revision process. Since NOCTI’s assessment development methods rely on subject matter experts to assess the relationship between the assessment content and the defined universe of the job title, NOCTI assessments are a content valid measure of the required skills in a given job title. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) state that content-related evidence demonstrates the degree to which the sample of items, tasks, or questions on a test are representative of some defined universe or domain of content. The methods often rely on expert judgments to assess this relationship. Thus, the content validity of NOCTI Assessments is in accordance with the Standards endorsed by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).\n\nThe reliability of an assessment refers to its consistency of measurement (i.e., the absence of measurement errors). NOCTI works to ensure that all of the assessments that we create have a stable and consistent performance of measurement. One approach used to demonstrate that an assessment is providing a reliable measurement of participant skill and/or knowledge is internal consistency. This measure is often used with written (cognitive) assessments and is calculated using a statistical software package such as SPSS or item analysis programs; NOCTI utilizes both types of programs.  The higher the internal consistency the more reliable the assessment.\n"

If an individual answers an item incorrectly, no points are given.  All items that are not answered are counted as incorrect.  Scores are calculated by standard area and by total.  Standard scores are determined by dividing the number of questions answered correctly by the number possible within the standard.  Standard scores are considered weighted because each standard does not contain the same number of questions.  Scores are represented by percentages.  A total score is calculated by dividing the total number of questions answered correctly across all standard areas by the total number of points possible across standard areas.",
