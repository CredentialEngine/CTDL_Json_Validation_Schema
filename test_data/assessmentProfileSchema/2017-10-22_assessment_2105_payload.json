      "ceterms:verificationMethodDescription": "A key strength of all NOCTI assessments concerns content validity. That validity is based upon the fact that each assessment is built upon national/industry standards and reflects the critical core competencies required in the occupation as reflected in associated job-task analyses performed during the development/revision process. Since NOCTI’s assessment development methods rely on subject matter experts to assess the relationship between the assessment content and the defined universe of the job title, NOCTI assessments are a content valid measure of the required skills in a given job title. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) state that content-related evidence demonstrates the degree to which the sample of items, tasks, or questions on a test are representative of some defined universe or domain of content. The methods often rely on expert judgments to assess this relationship. Thus, the content validity of NOCTI Assessments is in accordance with the Standards endorsed by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).\n\nThe reliability of an assessment refers to its consistency of measurement (i.e., the absence of measurement errors). NOCTI works to ensure that all of the assessments that we create have a stable and consistent performance of measurement. One approach used to demonstrate that an assessment is providing a reliable measurement of participant skill and/or knowledge is internal consistency. This measure is often used with written (cognitive) assessments and is calculated using a statistical software package such as SPSS or item analysis programs; NOCTI utilizes both types of programs.  The higher the internal consistency the more reliable the assessment.\n"

In addition, all appropriate related supportive curriculum materials as well as item writing guidelines are provided.   Assessments are developed in accordance with the committee’s established blueprint and recommendations.  NOCTI staff provides available relevant test items to the committee members from the NOCTI item bank.\n\nOnce the draft test is assembled, a bias review is performed on all items/jobs in the new test and appropriate revisions are made.\n\nEach NOCTI written test is subjected to a readability analysis to ensure the test parallels, but does not exceed, the reading level required in the industry. \n\nThe new assessment is pilot tested on a sample of individuals to ensure times/job criteria on the performance test are appropriate and to determine that items on the written test are functioning properly.  The sample includes representation from various areas of the country.  The results of the pilot tests are compiled and analyzed through an item analysis.  The results of the item analysis indicate item difficulty and discrimination, mean, standard deviation, range of scores, Kuder-Richardson 20 or Cronbach’s Alpha reliability index, and the standard error of measurement.\n\nNOCTI provides clients with a variety of cut score options.

      "ceterms:verificationMethodDescription": "A key strength of all NOCTI assessments concerns content validity. That validity is based upon the fact that each assessment is built upon national/industry standards and reflects the critical core competencies required in the occupation as reflected in associated job-task analyses performed during the development/revision process. Since NOCTI’s assessment development methods rely on subject matter experts to assess the relationship between the assessment content and the defined universe of the job title, NOCTI assessments are a content valid measure of the required skills in a given job title. The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014) state that content-related evidence demonstrates the degree to which the sample of items, tasks, or questions on a test are representative of some defined universe or domain of content. The methods often rely on expert judgments to assess this relationship. Thus, the content validity of NOCTI Assessments is in accordance with the Standards endorsed by the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).\n\nThe reliability of an assessment refers to its consistency of measurement (i.e., the absence of measurement errors). NOCTI works to ensure that all of the assessments that we create have a stable and consistent performance of measurement. One approach used to demonstrate that an assessment is providing a reliable measurement of participant skill and/or knowledge is internal consistency. This measure is often used with written (cognitive) assessments and is calculated using a statistical software package such as SPSS or item analysis programs; NOCTI utilizes both types of programs.  The higher the internal consistency the more reliable the assessment.\n"

Assessments are selected for revision based on a rotation schedule, comments received from users, and on changes in the occupation.  When NOCTI determines that an assessment must be revised, a revision committee is convened with the same representation of content experts as the test development committees.  The revision committee re-evaluates the assessment and changes are made as recommended.  \n\nUser comments on assessments are reviewed, sent to subject matter experts if appropriate, and resolved on an ongoing basis.  Minor changes that do not affect the content or scoring rubric of the test are made between revision cycles; major changes are addressed during the revision process which typically occurs every three years.",

The resulting critical core competencies, tasks and steps are then ranked and quantified to create a blueprint for the assessment being developed.  Once the blueprint is developed, written test questions and performance test jobs are developed or revised to reflect the stated specifications.  Committee members are asked to determine which critical core competencies are best illustrated on the written and performance portions of the test and which can effectively be measured on both components.\n\nNOCTI staff provides each committee member with all appropriate test-related materials.  In addition, all appropriate related supportive curriculum materials as well as item writing guidelines are provided.   Assessments are developed in accordance with the committee’s established blueprint and recommendations.  NOCTI staff provides available relevant test items to the committee members from the NOCTI item bank.\n\nOnce the draft test is assembled, a bias review is performed on all items/jobs in the new test and appropriate revisions are made.\n\nEach NOCTI written test is subjected to a readability analysis to ensure the test parallels, but does not exceed, the reading level required in the industry. \n\nThe new assessment is pilot tested on a sample of individuals to ensure times/job criteria on the performance test are appropriate and to determine that items on the written test are functioning properly.  The sample includes representation from various areas of the country.  The results of the pilot tests are compiled and analyzed through an item analysis.  The results of the item analysis indicate item difficulty and discrimination, mean, standard deviation, range of scores, Kuder-Richardson 20 or Cronbach’s Alpha reliability index, and the standard error of measurement.\n\nNOCTI provides clients with a variety of cut score options.  NOCTI provides normative data that may be used as a benchmark as well as criterion-referenced cut scores for each of its job ready assessments.  Clients also have the option of setting their own cut scores on the assessments.  \n",
