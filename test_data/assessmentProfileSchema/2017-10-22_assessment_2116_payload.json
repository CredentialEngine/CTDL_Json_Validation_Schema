  "ceterms:scoringMethodDescription": "The Board set the passing standard as the number of test questions it determines to be necessary for candidates to answer correctly in order to be considered at least minimally competent. This method focuses on the particular test that is being administered. Different forms of an examination are matched for difficulty and content coverage. This comprehensive approach makes use of information about the performance of similar groups in the past.\n\nABRET is concerned with reporting only valid scores. On rare occasions, misconduct or circumstances beyond the individualâ€™s control may render a score invalid. If doubts are raised about a score because of these or other circumstances, ABRET reserves the right to cancel any examination score if, in the sole opinion of ABRET, there is adequate reason to question its validity.",
