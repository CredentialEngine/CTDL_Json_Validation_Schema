  "ceterms:description": "Individuals demonstrate their understanding of the core skills and knowledge though five assessments based upon MSSC's industry-defined, nationally validated skill standards.    Delivered online, each assessment contains about 80-90 multiple-choice questions (paper versions are available in special circumstances).  Individuals are allowed 90 minutes to complete each assessment.  MSSC provides assessment scores as soon as the individual completes an assessment showing whether an individual met the “cut” scores for passing.  This immediate feedback includes a diagnostic report for the individual showing how he or she scored on the key work activities.  This information is intended for self-improvement and is provided to all test-takers whether they pass or not.\n\nGeneral Policies\n\nIf assessments are not passed on the first attempt the individual must wait 15 calendar days before retaking the assessment.  If the individual does not pass a second time, he/she must wait another 15 calendar days.  If the individual does not pass the third time, he/she must wait 60 calendar days before taking the assessment again.  There are no discounts for assessment retakes.  Individuals must pass all four CPTAE required assessments within two years in order to achieve the full-CPTAE certification.  MSSC strongly recommends that individuals be at a 9th-grade math and 10th-grade reading level.",
