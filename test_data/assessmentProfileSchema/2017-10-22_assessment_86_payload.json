  "ceterms:description": "The MLT(ASCP) and MLT(ASCPi) certification examination is composed of 100 examination questions given in a 2 hour 30 minute time frame. All examination questions are multiple-choice with one best answer. The certification examination is administered using the format of computer adaptive testing (CAT).\nWith CAT, when a person answers a question correctly, the next test question has a slightly higher level of difficulty. The difficulty level of the questions presented to the examinee continues to increase until a question is answered incorrectly. Then a slightly easier question is presented. In this way, the test is tailored to the individualâ€™s ability level.",
