  "ceterms:description": "The examination content is divided into three content domains: Nutrition Science and Care for Individuals and Groups\n(44%); Food Science and Food Service (24%); and Management of Food and Nutrition Services (32%). The examination\nincludes questions that are intended to test at either the comprehension or application level. Comprehension questions\nrequire accurate understanding of concepts, principles, and procedures, and include the ability to translate information\npresented in different formats, such as graphs, tables, and formulas. Questions at the application level generally involve\nusing information or knowledge to solve a problem, make a decision, select a course of action, and so on.\nThe examination is computer based and variable length. Each examinee will be given a minimum of one hundred and\nten (110) questions; eighty (80) scored questions and thirty (30) pretest questions. The maximum number of questions\npossible is one hundred and thirty (130); one hundred (100) scored questions and thirty (30) unscored pretest\nquestions. In order to receive a passing or a failing score report, the examinee must complete between 110–130\nquestions. During the examination, if the examinee does not respond to the minimum of 110 questions (for\nwhatever reason), he/she will receive a failing score report. Pretesting is done to see how well items perform before\nthey are used in the scored portion of any examination. The pretest questions cannot be distinguished from those\nthat will be scored, so it is important that examinees answer all questions.\nAll of the questions on the examination are intended to be practice-related. Questions from any of the three (3) content\ndomains can appear anywhere in the examination; they are intermingled and do not appear in content order.",
