We can measure this in several different ways, including previous college credit you've earned, SAT/PSAT or ACT scores, high school GPA or through an assessment tool called Accuplacer! If you have test scores or transcripts to send, you can upload them when you apply. If you don't have them when you complete the application, don't worry!",
