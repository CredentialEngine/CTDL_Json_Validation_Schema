You will also learn “lean” manufacturing principles and develop productive work behaviors that provide excellent self-development skills that are very attractive to employers. The course work implements the multidisciplinary, multiskilled model with courses in electricity, fluid power, mechanics, fabrication, troubleshooting, problem solving, etc.",
