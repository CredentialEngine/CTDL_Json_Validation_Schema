  "ceterms:description": "Vincennes Universityâ€™s EMS Program goal is to prepare competent entry-level Paramedics in the cognitive, psychomotor and affective learning domains by providing students with the nationally accepted knowledge and skills via a combination of didactic, lab, clinical and internship opportunities.\n\nThe EMS-Paramedic Program consists of two tracks, a one-year Certificate and the AS degree. Students who successfully complete the paramedic program are eligible to take the National Registry Examination. Upon successful completion of this exam and subsequent licensure graduates may function as a paramedic working with physician direction to manage medical emergencies of acutely ill or injured patients in a variety of settings.\n\nThose interested in the one-year certificate are required to possess a current EMT certification and a year's experience prior to entering the program. Those wishing to begin the AS degree program will receive EMT training during their first semester. These students are expected to obtain experience as a Basic-EMT during their second semester in the program.\n\nThe EMS Program is a selective admissions program. Admission is competitive and admission to VU does not indicate admission to the EMS Program. Students should recognize the intense nature of the program including both hospital and EMS clinical rotations, as well as a summer Capstone requiring effective team leadership skills in a variety of EMS agencies.",
