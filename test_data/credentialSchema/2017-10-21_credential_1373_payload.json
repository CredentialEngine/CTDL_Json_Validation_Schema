  "ceterms:description": "The Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (BSPS) is a four-year degree program that begins with a foundation of coursework in mathematics and the basic sciences -- chemistry, biology, and physics. This interdisciplinary program then progresses to advanced coursework in the pharmaceutical sciences, including aspects of drug design and synthesis, mechanisms of drug action, pharmacology and toxicology, dosage formulation, manufacturing, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance. This is not a professional degree program and completion of the BSPS degree does not qualify graduates to take the state board examination to become a registered pharmacist.\n\nThe four-year BSPS program trains students for diverse positions in industrial, academic, or other research environments within the areas of drug discovery, development, and commercialization. It also prepares students for professional or graduate studies in graduate education in pharmaceutical, medical, and basic sciences and post-baccalaureate professional education in medicine, law, and business.",
