  "ceterms:description": "Globally recognized and demanded, the PMP certification demonstrates to employers, clients and colleagues that a project manager possesses project management knowledge, experience and skills to bring projects to successful completion. As the demand for skilled project managers is at a critically urgent level, practitioners who hold the PMP certification are well positioned to provide the professional skills necessary to lead project teams and achieve successful project results.\n\nThe PMP® credential recognizes the competence of an individual to perform in the role of a project manager, specifically experience in leading and directing projects. Year after year, the PMP certification has garnered global recognition and commanded a higher salary for certified individuals over non-certified\nindividuals. The Project Management Professional (PMP®) is the most important industry-recognized certification for project managers.\n\nYou can find PMPs leading projects in nearly every country and, unlike other certifications that focus on a particular geography or domain, the PMP® is truly global. As a PMP, you can work in virtually any industry, with any methodology and in any location.\n\nThe PMP® certification scheme is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) against the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17024. The 17024 standard includes vigorous requirements for examination development and maintenance and for the quality management systems for continuing quality assurance. In addition, the PMP certification is also registered against the ISO 9001:2008 standard for quality management systems. This accreditation provides a third-party affirmation of quality in the development, management and governance of the PMP® certification. It also gives certification holders and organizations who employ them additional confidence in the PMP® certification.",
