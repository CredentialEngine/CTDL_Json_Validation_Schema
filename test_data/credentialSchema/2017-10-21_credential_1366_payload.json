  "ceterms:description": "Under this plan, you complete three years of course work at IPFW and then spend 12 months in an approved hospital medical technology program. To earn a B.S. with a major in medical technology under the 3+1 program, you must fulfill the requirements of IPFW (see Part 7) and the School of Arts and Sciences (see Part 3). You must also earn a GPA of 2.50 or higher in the biology core and in Group B-elective courses in biology. All biology courses applied toward graduation must be completed within 10 years from the time the first biology course was completed.\n\nThe Department of Biology has new facilities for its teaching and research programs, and its faculty represent many different fields within biology.\n\nIn the first semester of your junior year, you should see your advisor for assistance with applying to an approved school of medical technology. An approved school is one certified by Purdue University; Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne is among those affiliated with this program.\n\nWhen you are admitted to the hospital school for your final year, you must maintain registered-student status at IPFW for the fall and spring semesters and for both summer sessions. Upon successful completion of 12 months in the hospital school, you may substitute that experience for as much as 32 credits toward the B.S. in medical technology. You are responsible for seeing that IPFW receives official notification that you have successfully completed the hospital program.",
