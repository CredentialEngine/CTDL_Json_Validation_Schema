  "ceterms:description": "This certificate program is designed primarily for professionals and paraprofessionals who are interested in becoming specialists in the area of substance abuse counseling. The courses could, however, benefit a wide variety of persons, including teachers, school counselors and administrators, personnel counselors, nurses, and ministers. This program will train students to recognize and treat substance abusers as well as to develop prevention and treatment programs. Fieldwork will be required with some of the courses. A certificate program provides students with a Certificate of Completion, not an associate degree and not a credential to be a fully certified counselor. Students wishing to receive a degree should major in social work or another behavioral science program and then specialize in the Substance Abuse Program.",
