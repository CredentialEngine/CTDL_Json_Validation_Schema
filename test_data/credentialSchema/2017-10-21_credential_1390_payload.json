  "ceterms:description": "The undergraduate nursing program is designed to prepare the professional nurse as a generalist to plan, implement, and evaluate healthcare for individuals, families, and groups in institutional and community settings.\n\nCompletion of the undergraduate program provides the foundation for professional practice and graduate study in nursing. Students completing and meeting the requirements for graduation from the nursing program will be eligible to sit for the registered nurse licensure exam.\n\nIn addition to classroom instruction and simulated learning activities, clinical learning occurs in local hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, clinics, and a number of other agencies. Students gain experience with patients in medical, surgical, psychiatric, maternity, pediatric, gerontology, oncology, operating room, critical care, emergency room, post-anesthesia, and community settings. Clinical practice prepares students for employment in these areas following graduation.",
