  "ceterms:description": "Physical Therapist Assistants (PTA) are allied health professionals who assist the Physical Therapist in treating patients of all ages specifically focused on the diagnostic and interventional treatment of patients with musculoskeletal, neurological, and certain general medical disorders under the care of the Physical Therapist. The PTA Program is a consolidated program with three military services that has a two stage, field of study schedule. Formal didactic training is conducted within METCâ€™s facilities and then hands-on clinical training is conducted at military and/or civilian medical treatment facilities (MTF).\n\nUpon initial entry to METC, students are provided formal education and training that develops them into entry-level Physical Therapy Assistants/Specialists/Technicians within fixed and deployable medical facilities. Students will learn the physical therapy mission and scope of practice, duties and responsibilities of a physical therapy assistant. The PTA Program provides simulated and live training in all aspects of Physical Therapy medicine to include functional human anatomy, physiology, kinesiology, clinical pathophysiology, and musculoskeletal physical therapy assessment and management. Student receive an introduction to therapeutic exercises, procedures, modalities (Physical Agents: Spinal Traction, Ultrasound, Electrotherapy, Theory and application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), and iontophoresis), neurological and medical disorders, physical therapy assessments, clinical management, professional communication, psychosocial issues in health care, and clinical experiences. Quality control and safety techniques are emphasized throughout the program. Instruction and practice in medical ethics, patient care, and a comprehensive pre-clinical review prepare students to transition to a clinical setting. Lecture, demonstration, online materials, simulations, and laboratory practice are utilized during their pre-clinical training. The courses for the PTA Program are taught using a regional approach. During the first four weeks, the basics of anatomy, physiology, and kinesiology are taught. After week four, detailed anatomy, kinesiology, clinical disorders, clinical screening, manual therapy, and therapeutic exercises are taught as they pertain to the anatomical region being studied. These regions include spine; hip and pelvis; knee; foot and ankle; shoulder, and elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. With this regional approach, a complete course is not taught at one time during the program. Instead, courses are taught in separate units and lessons throughout the duration of the program. The training consists of lectures, group activities, demonstrations, hands-on instruction and clinical practice. Performance exercises, presentations, written examinations, and clinical/practicum are used to assess accumulation and retention of knowledge and skills.\n\nClinical training provides students with clinical knowledge and hands-on experiential training which consists of clinical practicum in a MTF. Students will train in the areas of: professional behavior, communication skills (written and verbal), examination skills (goniometry, manual muscle testing, and gait assessment), treatment skills, and general skills (safety, record reviews, critical thinking, patient assessment, infection control, body mechanics, and patient positioning). Such training will include training in outpatient orthopedics, inpatient acute care, and neuromusculoskeletal rehabilitation. Students will also carry out prescribed physical therapy treatment programs to include the following: transfer training, gait training, bed mobility, therapeutic exercise instruction, patient and family education, and application of physical modalities such as ultrasound, traction, iontophoresis, electrical stimulation, head, and cold. As available, students will also receive training specific to geriatrics, pediatrics, wound and burn care, and amputee care. Additionally, students will receive training with evidence-based clinical case studies. Proficiency advancement in clinical applications is determined by the program director and clinical advisor/coordinator on a case-by-case basis.",
