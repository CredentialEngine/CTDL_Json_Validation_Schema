      "ceterms:description": "The chart below shows the official cost of attendance for different kinds of students who are seeking an associate degree or certificate.   Federal student aid (FSA) regulations require us to use cost of attendance to help calculate your financial aid eligibility.  Financial aid need, as defined by FSA, is cost of attendance minus EFC (the result of your FAFSA). \n\nBe aware that \"cost of attendance\" is not the same as your bill for any given semester or year.  For example, VU does not bill you for transportation or personal expenses, but we can include reasonable amounts for these categories of expenses that all students have.\n\nIn calculating your cost of attendance, we also add program expenses if your major requires such things as tools that you must purchase or course fees that all students in a particular major must pay.  You can get up-to-date information about these sorts of costs from your major academic department. \n\nIf you have questions about any of this, you are welcome to contact the student financial services office at 812.888.4361.",
