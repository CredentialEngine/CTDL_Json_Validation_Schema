  "ceterms:description": "Since 1865, we've stood up: For hard work. For solid values. For sycamore trees. And for you.\n\nWe believe in public schools, public health, and the public good. We pursue happiness. Fairness. Opportunity. And the chance for every person to get a great education.\n\nThatâ€™s why we offer more than 100 majors, 60+ online programs, and endless opportunities for our students (undergraduate and graduate). We challenge them to grow and learn inside and outside the classroom. And to make an impact on the community, whether right here in Terre Haute or halfway around the world.",
