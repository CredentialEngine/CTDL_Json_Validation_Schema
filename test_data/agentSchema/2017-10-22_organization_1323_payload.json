  "ceterms:description": "Large campuses can be intimidating and overwhelming. You can get lost in the crowd and feel like you are just one of many. Not at IU South Bend. Our campus is a welcoming and inclusive community. Every student has the opportunity to succeed and experience college life to the fullest, in and out of the classroom, with the support of professors and fellow students.\n\nWe're the Titans. At a smaller campus you get the room you need to stretch your imagination. Where you can build your reputation as you build your credentials. IU South Bend gives you the space you need to become who you're really meant to be. Here you can strengthen your voice and find your purpose.\n\nOur ambitions are absolute. Our spirit is unstoppable. And we're undoubtedly going to change the world for the better.",
